### Summary

Hi, 

I am Marius and I am Software Engineer with 4+ years of experience in developing complex Web and Desktop
apps. Due to my curious mind I worked in different industries like supply chain, project management, artificial
intelligence, big pharmacology. One of my best professional strengths is the passion for learning and my
ideal place is one where growth is encouraged and supported. My main technology skills are Java, Spring, AWS,
JavaScript, React, SQL and React but I love exploring new technologies as well. I have EU pre-settled status which
gives me the right to work and live in UK without a visa.

In the coming years I will be focusing on expanding my knowledge and skills in **Artificial Intelligence** and **Cloud Computing**.

In my free time I like to socialize with friends, practice martial arts, travel or enjoy good books.
I also teach Computer Science on [superprof.co.uk](https://www.superprof.co.uk/high-performer-senior-eng-teaches-computer-science-algorithms-and-how-think-like-programmer-can-teach-mentor-anyone-from.html).
